# GerLegalIR: German Legal Information Retrieval System

GerLegalIR is a comprehensive information retrieval system designed for German legal documents. It implements various retrieval methods, including TF-IDF, BM25, and neural approaches using bi-encoders and cross-encoders.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Sentence Transformers
- sklearn
- numpy
- tqdm
- pymongo
## Setup

1. Clone the repository(it is important to name the folder gerlegalir):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MarcelFaizi/gerlegalir ./gerlegalir
   cd gerlegalir
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, you may use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install the project in editable mode:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. Set up MongoDB:
   - Install MongoDB on your system if not already installed.
   - Update the `MONGODB_URI` in `config.py` with your MongoDB connection string.

## Configuration

The `config.py` file contains various settings that can be adjusted:

- `SEEDS`: Random seeds for reproducibility
- `PRETRAINED_BIENCODER`: List of pretrained bi-encoder model names
- `FINETUNED_BIENCODER`: List of finetuned bi-encoder model names
- `EVALUATION_K_VALUES`: K values for evaluation metrics
- `BM25_FILENAME`: Filename for saving/loading BM25 model
- `MONGODB_URI`: URI for MongoDB connection
- `MONGODB_DATABASE`: Name of the MongoDB database
- `ENSEMBLE_CONFIGS`: Configurations for ensemble methods

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Obtain the GerLegalText dataset by running /script/gerlegaltext_scraper.py
   - Obtain the GerLayQA dataset(BÃ¼ttner and Habernal, Answering legal questions from laymen in German civil law system, 2024) by visiting: https://github.com/trusthlt/eacl24-german-legal-questions and downloading /data/GerLayQA.json
   - (alternatively, you can use your own dataset that has the data "Question_text" and "Paragraphs" for each entry)
   - Ensure your legal documents are in the correct format and location.
   - Update the `GerLayQADataset` and `LegalTextDataset` classes in `data_loader.py` if necessary.

2. Run the main evaluation script:
   ```
   python main.py <system_type>
   ```
   Where `<system_type>` can be one of:
   - pretrained
   - finetuned
   - ensemble

   This script will:
   - Initialize the specified class of retrieval systems
   - Evaluate each system on the test set
   - Store results in MongoDB

3. To run a specific experiment or modify parameters, you can edit the `main.py` file or create a new script using the provided classes and functions.

## Adding New Retrieval Systems

To add a new retrieval system:

1. Create a new class in `retrieval_systems.py` that inherits from `RetrievalSystem`.
2. Implement the `get_relevant_documents` method in your new class.
3. Add the new system to the `initialize_retrieval_systems` function in `main.py`.

## Results and Analysis
The system evaluates retrieval performance using the following metrics:
- Precision@5 and Precision@10
- Recall@5 and Recall@10
- F1-score@5 and F1-score@10
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)

Results are stored in MongoDB. You can use these results to:
- Compare the performance of different retrieval methods
- Analyze the impact of different model configurations
